basketballreference.com scraper:

Completing the dream of finally being able to look up basketball stats from a 
terminal.

NOTE: NO LONGER WORKS SINCE basketballreference UPDATED/CHANGED THE LAYOUT OF 
      THEIR SITE.

Future project: change code to work with new site (or look to see if theres an
                existing api for this sort of thing)


Written for two main reasons:
    1) I wanted to practice/experiment with using the python lmxl module for 
       web scraping.
    2) I kept looking up basketball stats and the site is a little hard to 
       navigate (plus its a lot more subtle to be in a terminal in class than
       a website).


usage: python bball.py -[player] -[stat] -[g/36/100/tot]
